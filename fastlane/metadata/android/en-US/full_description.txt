Confroid is an Android application allowing centralized configurations management.
Any application installed on the device will have the option of entrusting the storage of its configuration to Confroid rather than performing this task itself.
The user will be able to edit the configurations of an application using Confroid.
The configurations will be stored in a transactional mode with a version history.
